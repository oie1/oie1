This letter serves as a formal cease and desist notice regarding your 
unauthorized use, modification, and distribution of software and assets 
governed by the Pyro Source Available License (PSAL) from Pyro Host 
Inc., specifically within the repository located at 
https://github.com/denisapain/pyronocherry.

It has come to our attention that you have removed our license checking 
and prevention mechanisms, which are clearly marked in the files, and

which governs the use of our software and assets.

We demand that you immediately cease and desist from all unauthorized 
use, modification, and distribution of our software and assets. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the deletion of any and all copies of 
the software and assets from your repository and any other platforms 
where they may have been distributed.

Furthermore, we require that you provide written confirmation of your 
compliance with this cease and desist notice within 48 hours of receipt.
This confirmation must include a detailed account of the steps you have 
taken to comply with our demands, including the removal of all 
unauthorized copies of our software and assets.

Failure to comply with this notice will leave us with no choice but to 
pursue legal action to protect our rights and interests. This may

available under applicable laws.
We trust that you understand the seriousness of this matter and will 
take immediate action to resolve it. If you have any questions or wish
